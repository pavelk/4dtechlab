Site Concept & Goals

The website’s goal is to provide an international platform based on Tech-experts’ knowledge-sharing with editorial content that enriches their capabilities and business opportunities. They will find it beneficial to return to the site on a daily basis because it provides them with ideas and information.

Tech-lab Online Platform should support/increase business opportunities inside Euro RSCG agencies by sharing Tech-experts’ tools between each others, or connecting experts across 4D Digital agencies all over the world.

Approved Tech-experts will publish their content (tools, case-studies, forum posts, events). Users can view the current/past topics.

The content needs to be up to date and engaging.

The site design is a template in which the content can fit. It is flexible to add text or video reviews; allow or disallow user comments; give room for links and forms etc.
